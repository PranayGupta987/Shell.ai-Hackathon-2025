## 💡 Key Takeaways

- ML + chemistry requires respecting the **physics** and **constraints** of the domain  
- Deep tabular models (like FT-Transformer) work well when combined with **feature-rich inputs**  
- Ensembling different model types improves robustness  
- Real-world modeling challenges involve **data cleaning, domain understanding, and iteration** – not just model tuning
